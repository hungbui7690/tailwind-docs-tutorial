          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
          terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a
          strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
          or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that
          moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
